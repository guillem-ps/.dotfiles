# Useful Terminal Plugins

In the following file, I will introduce some interesting plugins for the terminal that can enhance your experience by improving visualization and usability.

Here are the plugins I recommend:


- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.
- [gping](https://github.com/orf/gping): A better `ping` tool that provides real-time graphs of network latency. 
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa): A modern replacement for `ls` with more features and better defaults.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder that can be used to enhance various terminal workflows.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> If you installed the plugins after the copy of .bash_alias, you must copy the .bash_alias from the repository to your home directory again.

To make the installation process easier, there is also a bash script available that will prompt you to install each plugin. If you encounter any issues with the installation or if you are not using Ubuntu or Debian, it is recommended to visit the respective GitHub repositories for more detailed installation instructions.

>[!NOTE]
>Please note that **gping** is not part of the script, as it is a more specialized tool.
