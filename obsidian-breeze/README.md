# Obsidian Breeze

## Introduction

Obsidian Breeze is a refined adaptation of the original [Rainglow GitHub Contrast Theme](https://github.com/rainglow/vscode) by Dayle Rees, designed to offer a sleek, visually pleasing experience. It maintains the elegant contrasts of the original theme, with several tweaks for improved readability and a modernized terminal color palette.

## Features
- Dark theme with carefully tuned contrasts for clear visibility.
- Custom terminal colors that enhance the overall look and feel.
- Ideal for developers who prefer minimal distraction while maintaining style.
