# Tmux custom configuration

## Installation

To install `tmux.conf`, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.dotfiles/tmux/` directory to the `.config/` directory by running the following command:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.config/tmux/ -p # Create it if none exist
    cp ~/.dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.config/tmux/
    ```

2. Once the directory is moved, you can start customizing the `tmux.conf` file according to your preferences.

That's it! You have successfully installed `tmux.conf` and can now configure it to enhance your tmux experience.
